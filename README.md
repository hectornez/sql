# SQL course

Welcome to this repository, I have created this course as it is essential to any developer. Here you can find the installation proccess in linux, the main commands, different types of querys, creation and managoing of a DB and create and operate an instance in AWS. Just check out the pdf (Step by step guide), and the scripts. DB are not included but I could provide them on demand.
